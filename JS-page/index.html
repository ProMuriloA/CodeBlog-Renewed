        <h1 class="h1 mt-4">Hello, World!</h1>
        <h2 class="h2 mt-3">Today's topic is... <span style="font-weight: bold;">JS!</span></h2>
        <p class="mt-5" >JS is a multi-purpose tool; It can be used as a back-end or as a front-end tool.
             As a back-end, it can be used via terminal, in a local machine. As a front-end tool it will be interpreted by the browser, which gives
            interactivity to the content displayed.</p>
        <p class="mt-1">Javascript is a programming language (more specifically, it is a scripting language).
             To learn it you have to learn topics such as programming logic, which encompasses: loops, 
             conditionals, variables, functions, data types, classes and other. As a part of operating it,
              it is necessary to know how to import modules, how to do mathematical operations, it's 
              syntax and its intrinsic details.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-1">  Javascript is the most used programming language on the internet, specially in the front-end
            of the websites, without it, most of the websites would lose it's functionalities, without Javascript
            all the pages would be static (static webpages resemble Wikipedia articles because they have content
            however it is not very interactive.)
        </p>
        <p class="mt-1" >As a front-end tool, the JS is generally used with a framework or a library, which facilitates the development
            and gives scalability to the whole enterprise. One kind of JS library is React, which has some tools with already developed code that enhances and leverages
            the programmers' ability to develop quality code with minimum waste of time.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-1">
            As a back-end tool, the JS is generally used for interal server logic. Node.js is one powerful tool for implementing back-end functionalities with JS. As a Javascript Runtime Environment, it can be used to run Javascript locally.
            But be careful, JS has a syntax, JS for Node.Js has another and React.Js has a completely different kind of sytnax. If used correctly, it'll help you a lot!
